## Project Structure

This portfolio is organized into the following modules:

*   **`01_SQL_Scripts`**: Database schema design and management scripts.
*   **`02_Python_ETL`**: 
    *   Automated extraction scripts for **Avansat** (TMS) and **Satrack** (GPS/Telematics).
    *   Data transformation logic (cleaning, validation, normalization).
    *   Loading procedures into the data warehouse.
*   **`03_Access_VBA_Apps`**: Legacy frontend applications and macros for specific operational workflows.
*   **`04_PowerBI_Dashboards`** *(Excluded from repo for privacy/size, available upon request)*: Interactive dashboards for fleet management, cost analysis, and operational KPIs.
*   **`05_Python_desktop_app`**: A custom GUI application ("Orquestador") built to streamline:
    *   Invoice processing (Facturación).
    *   Manifest liquidation (Liquidación de Manifiestos).
    *   Automated data entry and validation.

## Key Technologies

*   **Languages**: Python (Pandas, Requests, Selenium/Playwright, Tkinter/PyQt), SQL, VBA.
*   **Databases**: MySQL / SQL Server.
*   **Visualization**: Power BI.
*   **Tools**: Git, Excel (as data source/output).

## Highlights

*   **End-to-End Automation**: Reduced manual data entry time by automating the interaction with third-party logistics platforms.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Modular ETL design allows for easy addition of new data sources.
*   **User-Centric Design**: The desktop app provides a friendly interface for non-technical operations staff to trigger complex background processes.
